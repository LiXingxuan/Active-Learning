# AL QBC diversity density balance committee-weighting
This active learning is about Query-by-committee algorithm (QBC) , while the basic QBC algorithm has been modified to performs better in resolving data imbalances and reducing labeling costs.In this project,qbc.ipynb file is used to test algorithm performance,and qbc_ddbcw.py file is used for practical application,which almost written according to sklearn standard.At the same time,qbc_ddbcw is a QBC algorithm that combines diversity,density,balance and committee-weighting.The other four pictures are about the performance of various QBC algorithms on CTG datasets(UCI).
